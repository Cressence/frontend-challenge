# Dearest Frontend Challenge

1. Clone and setup this repo
2. Create a Pull request that does these things:
    * Shows a form in a page with an input field and a submit button
    * Pressing the button hides the form and then shows a heart emoji and the content of the input field as a heading
    * Uses the orange colour scheme for all the elements

Hints: 
The Next.js documentation and the Chakra-ui documentation will help!
Extra credit for neatly organised components, etc.
